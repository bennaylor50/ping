Description: Tournament Ping Pong allows users to input multiple players and randomly creates pairings from the first round all the way to the final recording the winners along the way.

Codebase: Tournament Ping Pong has been built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The reason for this choice is that one of the most challenging parts of the fellowship for me has been learning React and Redux. One of my reason for this is that I felt my knowledge of javascript was not deep enough. Taking this into account I felt that this technical challenge presented an excellent opportunity to increase my depth of knowledge in javascript which it has done.
